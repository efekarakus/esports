            In this article, we take a look at fandom in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_sports" target="_blank">eSports</a>.
            More specifically, we focus on the European and North American 
            <a href="http://na.lolesports.com/" target="_blank">League of Legends Championship Series</a> (LCS).
            We compare the fan distributions for teams in the LCS from Season 4 to Season 5. The number of team has been increased to 10 for Season 5.

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">North America</h3>
            <div class="flow-holder" id="na">
                <div class="c c1"></div>
                <div class="c c2"></div>

                The oldest teams in North America, <a href="http://www.tsm.gg/" target="_blank">TSM</a> and 
                <a href="http://clgaming.net/" target="_blank">CLG</a>, have the largest fan base.
                TSM had 37% of the total fan base with a count of 24,295 fans in season 4. 
                They kept 81% of their fans transitioning to season 5 but 
                their support has decreased to 21,653. On the other hand, CLG gained supporters
                from season 4 to season 5. They have 26% of the fan base in season 5 with 17,020
                fans.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional sports, it is common for teams to re-brand from one season to another.
                Therefore, it is hard to achieve brand loyalty. The supporters seem to be more attached to personalities
                and team standings. Perhaps this can be best seen by taking a look at 
                <a href="http://team-dignitas.net/" target="_blank">Team Dignitas (DIG)</a>. Dignitas had 5,168 fans in season 4, but they dropped to 443 in season 5. When two DIG players, 
                <a href="https://twitter.com/dscarra" target="_blank">Scarra</a> and 
                <a href="https://twitter.com/ZionSpartan" target="_blank">ZionSpartan</a>, made the move to CLG, 29% of the DIG fan base transferred to CLG as well. Furthermore, the retirement of 
                <a href="https://twitter.com/Imaqtpielol" target="_blank">Imaqtpie</a> resulted in Dignitas keeping only 7% of their
                fans.

                Europe and North America are similar in that the oldest teams,
                such as <a href="http://www.fnatic.com/" target="_blank">Fnatic (FNC)</a>, have the most fans. 
                In this particular interactive, we can see how much performance matters. 
                At the time of the survey <i>(2/4/2014)</i>, <a href="http://www.sk-gaming.com/" target="_blank">SK Gaming</a> was undefeated. The number of supporters increased from 3,475 to 10,927 with 18% of the total fan base supporting them.

            <h2> Activity Rates </h2>
            <p>
            68,524 fans from the League of Legends subreddit participated in our 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kvthtsEmpCgEa5DrEQlyBRg4bz8bdQpYJsP8ccq0sFM/prefill" target="_blank">survey</a>. 
            We can see that the LCS has a stable number of fans. The North American
            LCS has around 64,795 and the European LCS has around 58,761 fans. 
            Furthermore, these numbers are really lower bounds.
            On <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">Twitch</a> alone, around 200,000 viewers regularly tune in to watch the LCS.
            <a href="http://www.riotgames.com/" target="_blank">Riot Games</a> also provides streams on 
            <a href="http://azubu.tv/" target="_blank">Azubu</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

            <h2> Fan Loyalty </h2>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional sports, eSports is not tied to a location. For NA, the tournament happens
                at the Riot Games studio in Los Angeles, CA. For EU, the tournament is in Berlin, Germany.
                Almost every team is staying near the city where the tournament takes place. Therefore, you don't necessarily
                see local support for the teams. In total, only 1 team out of 10 in both NA and EU has rosters with the same national background. Recently, however, both regions have brought on more players from Korea and China. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting on August 6, 2012, the LCS has been active for less than three years. Sponsorships cause team names to change frequently. For example, <a href="http://www.teamcurse.net/" target="_blank">Team Curse</a> became 
                <a href="http://www.teamliquid.net/" target="_blank">Team Liquid</a> and 
                <a href="http://thealliance.gg/" target="_blank">Alliance</a> renamed
                themselves to <a href="https://twitter.com/Elementsgg" target="_blank">Elements</a>. 
                Rosters also change frequently between splits depending on the performance of the players. In NA,
                only two teams from the previous split remained with the same roster out of 7 teams that continued. In EU, all the teams had a roster change.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the tables below, we display Loyalty Rates for both NA and EU. There were 7 teams that moved on
                from S4 to S5. In NA, <span class="neutral-positive">68%</span> of fans have supported the same team across both season.
                In EU, only <span class="neutral-negative">45%</span> of the viewers have supported the same team, which means
                more than half have switched over teams!
