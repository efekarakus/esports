            In this article, we take a look at fandom in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_sports" target="_blank">eSports</a>.
            More specifically, we focus on the European and North American <a href="http://na.lolesports.com/" target="_blank">LCS</a>.
            We take a look at the activity rate of fans, loyalty rates, and how loyalty changed between season 4 and 5.
            </p>

            <h2> Activity Rates </h2>
            <p>
            There were 68,524 fans that have participated in our
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kvthtsEmpCgEa5DrEQlyBRg4bz8bdQpYJsP8ccq0sFM/prefill" target="_blank">survey</a>
            on the League of Legends subreddit. We can see that the LCS has a stable number of fans. The North American
            LCS has around 64,795 and the European LCS has around 58,761 fans. 
            Furthermore, these numbers are really lower bounds.
            There are around 200,000 viewers tuning in to watch the LCS regularly solely on 
            <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">Twitch</a>.
            <a href="http://www.riotgames.com/" target="_blank">Riot Games</a> also provides streams on 
            <a href="http://azubu.tv/" target="_blank">Azubu</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

            <h2> Fan Loyalty </h2>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional sports, eSports is <b>not tied to a location</b>. For NA, the tournament happens
                at the Riot Games studio in Santa Monica, CA. For EU, the tournament is in Berlin, Germany.
                Almost every team is staying near the city where the tournament takes place. Therefore, you don't necessarily
                see local support for the teams.
                There are teams which the roster has mostly the same nationalities such as <a href="http://lol.gamepedia.com/Cloud9" target="_blank">C9</a> in NA 
                or <a href="http://lol.gamepedia.com/Team_ROCCAT" target="_blank">Giants!</a> in EU. 
                However, as of recently we see more players coming from Korea, and China into both regions. We counted
                only 1 team out of 10 in both NA and EU having the same nationalities for the players.
            </p>
            <p>
                The LCS has started only on August 6 2012. Team names change frequently due to mostly sponsorphip 
                related reasons. For example, <a href="http://lol.gamepedia.com/Curse_Gaming" target="_blank">Team Curse</a> became 
                <a href="http://lol.gamepedia.com/Team_Liquid" target="_blank">Team Liquid</a> or 
                <a href="http://lol.gamepedia.com/Alliance" target="_blank">Alliance</a> renamed
                themselves to <a href="http://lol.gamepedia.com/Elements" target="_blank">Elements</a>. 
                Rosters also change frequently between splits depending on the performance of the players. In NA,
                only two teams from the previous split remained with the same roster out of 7 teams that continued. In EU, all the teams had 
                a roster change. Due to these reasons, we don't see many fans being loyal to a brand.
                Fans are more attached to player personalities. There are few
                exceptions such as <a href="http://lol.gamepedia.com/TSM" target="_blank">TSM</a> or 
                <a href="http://lol.gamepedia.com/CLG" target="_blank">CLG</a>, as the scene progresses and teams establish
                themselves we expect to have fans being more loyal to a brand.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the tables below, we display <b>Loyalty Rates</b> for both NA and EU. There were 7 teams that moved on
                from S4 to S5. We count how many fans have supported the same team for both seasons. In NA, we can see that
                <span class="neutral-positive">68%</span> have supported the same team across both season.
                In EU, only <span class="neutral-negative">45%</span> of the viewers have supported the same team which means
                more than half have switched over teams!
